"You are braver than you believe" is a quote that I have on my desk to remain myself to keep pushing on everything that scares me. I have always been afraid to try something new. And for once I wanted to prove myself that I am capable of achieving the things that I once thought I would never do. 

About two years ago, I decided to make a career change. I was going to school for nursing, but it didn’t feel right. I loved learning what they were teaching me, but nursing wasn’t something I wanted to do for the rest of my life, it was more like my parents’ dream. One day, I decided to quit school and dedicate time to myself to work on finding out what was that I really wanted to do. I hear about coding from a friend. He said it was fun, and he seemed to love it. So, I thought, let me check it out! 

I watched a couple of videos on Python, and then on Ruby.  It seemed hard at first, and then I heard from other people and their experiences that it was challenging for them to learn coding. But then I thought, “push yourself! let’s do this!”. I practice a little bit of coding on Python on my own, so I stared to feel confident that maybe Software Engineer was the career for me. 

Then I decided to apply for Flatiron School, and the Bootcamp prep was an amazing experience, because even thou at first, I was scared that I was not going to be able to learn coding.  Now, even thou there are times that things seem to get harder and harder, it is really nice to know that I am not the only one going through it. And honestly, I feel that coding has taught me to push myself further than what I ever imagine, and I am loving the process on learning coding and having to be brave on trying something new.
