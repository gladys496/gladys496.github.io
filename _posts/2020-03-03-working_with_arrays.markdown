At first it was difficult for me to understand how arrays work. But then I began to understand how easy and helpful arrays are. Arrays help us to store a collection of information in one organized place. Arrays can be name, and set equal to a variable. We also have the ability to access data, add data or change the data that is already store in an array. One of the things that I find amazing about arrays is that you can store both strings and integers. But it is advice to keep your arrays populated with only one kind of dement. We also have a lot of different methods that help us to work better with arrays. For example, the shovel method (<<) and the. push method, will add to the end of an array. But if we want to add am element to the front of an array then we use .unshift method. This three methods are just a few of many methods we can use when working with arrays.
